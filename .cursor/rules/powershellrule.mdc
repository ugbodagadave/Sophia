# PowerShell Command Chaining

When working in a Windows PowerShell environment, **NEVER** use `&&` or `||` operators to chain commands in a single line. These are not valid separators in PowerShell.

Instead, use one of the following methods:

1.  **Semicolon (`;`)**: Use a semicolon to separate commands that should be executed sequentially, regardless of whether the previous command succeeds or fails.
    ```powershell
    git add . ; git commit -m "My commit message"
    ```

2.  **Separate `execute_command` calls**: For maximum reliability, execute each command in a separate `<execute_command>` tool call. This is the preferred method.
