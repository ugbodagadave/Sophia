# Progress

## Completed Phases

### Phase 0-5: Core Implementation ✅
- Repository structure and configuration management
- Document processing (OCR, PDF extraction, receipt parsing)
- Google Sheets integration for expense data
- Slack integration for file uploads and confirmations
- Analysis tools (categorization, reporting, query handling)
- PostgreSQL storage backend implementation
- Simplified user experience (confirmation-only Slack messages)

### Phase 6: Storage & User Experience ✅
- **PostgreSQL Storage Backend**: Implemented `integrations/postgres_storage.py` with BYTEA storage and UUID-based file management
- **Google Drive Removal**: Eliminated Google Drive dependencies, simplified to local/PostgreSQL storage only
- **Slack Confirmation Flow**: Changed from interactive blocks to simple "Receipt added to Google Sheet." confirmation
- **Reference Column**: Added unified `Reference` column in Google Sheets for file links
- **Live E2E Testing**: Successfully tested end-to-end flow with real Slack PDF upload

## Current Status
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL backend operational with `receipt_files` table
- **Slack Integration**: File downloads and confirmations working
- **Google Sheets**: Expense data and file references being written correctly
- **OCR/PDF Processing**: Tesseract OCR and PDF extraction functional
- **Tests**: 27/27 tests passing with updated expectations

## Remaining for Phase 6 Completion
- Live integration tests with pytest markers and environment flags
- Granite robustness improvements (retries, validation, logging)
- Documentation updates for live testing procedures

## Next Phase (Phase 7)
- Deployment to IBM watsonx Orchestrate
- Production monitoring and logging setup
