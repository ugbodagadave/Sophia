# Progress

## Completed Phases

### Phase 0-5: Core Implementation ✅
- Repository structure and configuration management
- Document processing (OCR, PDF extraction, receipt parsing)
- Google Sheets integration for expense data
- Slack integration for file uploads and confirmations
- Analysis tools (categorization, reporting, query handling)
- PostgreSQL storage backend implementation
- Simplified user experience (confirmation-only Slack messages)

### Phase 6: Storage & User Experience ✅
- **PostgreSQL Storage Backend**: Implemented `integrations/postgres_storage.py` with BYTEA storage and UUID-based file management
- **Google Drive Removal**: Eliminated Google Drive dependencies, simplified to local/PostgreSQL storage only
- **Slack Confirmation Flow**: Changed from interactive blocks to simple "Receipt added to Google Sheet." confirmation
- **Reference Column**: Added unified `Reference` column in Google Sheets for file links
- **Live E2E Testing**: Successfully tested end-to-end flow with real Slack PDF upload
- **Live Integration Tests**: Implemented comprehensive opt-in live tests with environment-gated execution
- **Granite Robustness**: Added retries, schema validation, and structured logging to Granite client
- **Documentation**: Enhanced with detailed live testing procedures and environment variable requirements

## Current Status
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL backend operational with `receipt_files` table
- **Slack Integration**: File downloads and confirmations working
- **Google Sheets**: Expense data and file references being written correctly
- **OCR/PDF Processing**: Tesseract OCR and PDF extraction functional
- **AI Integration**: Granite client with retry mechanisms and validation
- **Testing**: 30/30 tests passing with live tests skipped by default
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for live testing and API reference

## Phase 6 Completion Checklist ✅
- [x] Live integration tests with opt-in flags
- [x] Pytest markers and env-gated tests for Slack, Google Sheets, OCR, and E2E
- [x] Granite robustness with retry/backoff around Granite calls
- [x] JSON validation (pydantic model) for Granite responses with type coercion
- [x] Structured error logging and validation failure handling
- [x] Documentation updates for live tests and Granite robustness
- [x] Green test suite with live tests gated by flags

## Next Phase (Phase 7)
- Deployment to IBM watsonx Orchestrate
- Production monitoring and logging setup
- Performance optimization and scaling considerations
