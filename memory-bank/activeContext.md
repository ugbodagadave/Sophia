# Active Context

Current focus:
- Phase 6 implementation completed: PostgreSQL storage backend, simplified Slack confirmation flow, live integration tests, Granite robustness, and E2E runner
- E2E runner implemented with CLI options for verbose output and optional mocks
- PDF processing enhanced with OCR fallback for image-based PDFs
- All tests passing (30/30) with live tests skipped by default

Next steps:
- Prepare for Phase 7 deployment to IBM watsonx Orchestrate
- Consider production monitoring and logging setup
- Evaluate performance optimization opportunities

Recent achievements:
- Successfully implemented live integration tests with environment-gated execution
- Added Granite robustness: retries with exponential backoff, Pydantic schema validation, and structured error logging
- Enhanced documentation with detailed live testing procedures and environment variable requirements
- Implemented E2E runner with CLI options for processing Slack files with verbose output
- Added PDF OCR fallback for image-based PDFs to improve text extraction
- Maintained backward compatibility: all existing functionality preserved
- Comprehensive test coverage: unit tests, integration tests, and opt-in live tests

Key implementation details:
- Live tests use pytest markers: live_slack, live_sheets, live_ocr, live_e2e
- Environment variables: RUN_LIVE=1 plus granular flags for each test type
- Granite client: inner retry methods with outer safe wrappers that log and return defaults
- E2E runner: CLI tool with --mock-download, --real-sheets, --real-slack-post, --show-ocr, --show-parsed, --show-sheets-row options
- PDF processing: multi-stage extraction (pdfplumber → PyPDF2 → OCR fallback) for image-based PDFs
- Documentation: detailed examples for Windows (PowerShell/CMD) and macOS/Linux
