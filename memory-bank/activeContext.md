# Active Context

Current focus:
- Phase 6 implementation completed: PostgreSQL storage backend, simplified Slack confirmation flow, live integration tests, and Granite robustness
- Live integration tests implemented with opt-in environment flags and comprehensive documentation
- Granite client enhanced with retries, schema validation, and structured logging
- All tests passing (30/30) with live tests skipped by default

Next steps:
- Prepare for Phase 7 deployment to IBM watsonx Orchestrate
- Consider production monitoring and logging setup
- Evaluate performance optimization opportunities

Recent achievements:
- Successfully implemented live integration tests with environment-gated execution
- Added Granite robustness: retries with exponential backoff, Pydantic schema validation, and structured error logging
- Enhanced documentation with detailed live testing procedures and environment variable requirements
- Maintained backward compatibility: all existing functionality preserved
- Comprehensive test coverage: unit tests, integration tests, and opt-in live tests

Key implementation details:
- Live tests use pytest markers: live_slack, live_sheets, live_ocr, live_e2e
- Environment variables: RUN_LIVE=1 plus granular flags for each test type
- Granite client: inner retry methods with outer safe wrappers that log and return defaults
- Documentation: detailed examples for Windows (PowerShell/CMD) and macOS/Linux
