# Active Context

Current focus:
- Phase 6 implementation completed: PostgreSQL storage backend, simplified Slack confirmation flow
- Live E2E testing with Slack file URL successful
- Google Drive integration removed, storage now uses local or PostgreSQL only

Next steps:
- Implement live integration tests with pytest markers and environment flags
- Add Granite robustness (retry/backoff, JSON schema validation, structured logging)
- Update documentation for live testing procedures
- Prepare for Phase 7 deployment to IBM watsonx Orchestrate

Recent achievements:
- Successfully processed live Slack PDF upload with PostgreSQL storage
- Confirmed end-to-end flow: Slack → OCR/PDF extraction → PostgreSQL storage → Google Sheets → Slack confirmation
- Removed Google Drive dependencies, simplified architecture
- All tests passing (27/27) with updated expectations
